# Pixel/DMD Coordinate Transformations

In order to accurately predict the pixels corresponding to a set of micromirrors (and vice versa), we need to solve for the transformation matrix which will allow us to switch between the CCD and DMD coordinate systems.  This GUI takes images of a DMD pattern obtained with the SAMOS Imager and uses [Astropy WCS tools](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/wcs/index.html) to find a solution that is compatible with the [FITS WCS standard](https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_wcs.html).  This is in active development.

### Step 0
Upon running the script, a window will pop up where the user may load an image (Figure 1).
The image here is a 54x54 grid of points, the details of which are in the DMD pattern table `grid_54x54_dmd.csv`, which is loaded via the `Open DMD Pattern File` button. (There should be a way for the program to automatically select an image's corresponding pattern file, I will work on this.)

### Step 1
The first step of getting the coordinate transformation is to extract the point sources.  We need to specify the number of points we want to map out so the source extractor only reads the points we want. For a 54x54 grid, this would be 2,916 sources.  
(**However, because of the misalignment of the CCD when this image was taken, which can be seen in the edges of the image in Figure 1, in this example I am excluding the left column and top row to treat it as a grid of 53x53=2809 points, so that is the number we add to the input.**)

Then, enter the approximate FWHM for the points and run the star finder. 
When finished, each source is marked by a circle so we may check that the source extractor picked out all the correct point, with the table of extracted pixel coordinates displayed below the image (Figure 2).

### Step 2
Now that we have matched coordinates for both the CCD and DMD frames (remember we loaded the DMD pattern file in Step 0), we can initialize the affine transformation matrix solver.  Since slight warping at the edges of the CCD image is expected, we want include [SIP distortion](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/docs/files/spitzer/shupeADASS.pdf) in the fit.  Enter the degree of distortion that seems appropriate and run the fitting algorithm.
 
There are two transformations that we solve for: ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D%5Cbg%7Bwhite%7D%7B%5Ccolor%7BBlack%7D%20%20%5Ctextbf%7BDMD%7D_%7Bxy%7D%5Crightarrow%20%5Ctextbf%7BCCD%7D_%7Bxy%7D%20%5C%20%5Cmathrm%7Band%7D%20%5C%20%5Ctextbf%7BCCD%7D_%7Bxy%7D%5Crightarrow%20%5Ctextbf%7BDMD%7D_%7Bxy%7D%20%7D)

The names of the transformation functions are `ccd2dmd_wcs` and `dmd2ccd_wcs`, each of which can be inversely applied, giving 4 total coordinate transformation functions.

To check the accuracy of each, this step applies the transformations to the coordinates read from the pattern file (or source extraction table for CCD), and computes the difference between resulting X and Y coordinates and the known values.  
For instance, the `ccd2dmd_wcs` and (inverse)`dmd2ccd_wcs` transformations are applied to the pixel coordinates in the extracted sources table to produce two estimates for mirror locations on the DMD.  These output mirror coordinates are compared to the coordinates in the DMD pattern table.  The differences between $x_{in},x_{out}$ and $y_{in},y_{out}$ for both transformations are plotted as histograms (Figure 3).  Then, we have to decide which transformation function(s) work best.
